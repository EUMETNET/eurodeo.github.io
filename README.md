# Introduction

This is the RODEO project website created by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site generator and 
[Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

The site is available at https://rodeo-project.eu/

# Content updates

The main page can be altered by editing `index.markdown`

The navigation configuration can be found in `_data/navigation.yml`.

All pages in the navigation are under `_pages` as Markdown files.

# CI/CD

When a commit is made to the master branch, the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/EURODEO/eurodeo.github.io/actions/workflows/jekyll.yml)
workflow will update the page and publish it to https://rodeo-project.eu/

# Local development

If needed, the site can be developed also locally. Just clone the repository and follow instructions in https://jekyllrb.com/docs/
