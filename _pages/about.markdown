# Introduction

The Provision of Open Access to Public Meteorological Data and Development of Shared Federated Data Infrastructure for the Development of Information Products and
Services (RODEO) project is a joint effort by eleven European National Meteorological and Hydrological Services NMHSs, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF) and the network of 31 European National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (EUMETNET) with involvement also from European Organisation for the
Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) in the project External Advisory Board. The project will make meteorological High Value Datasets easily available
for various use cases by generating APIs and assisting providers in the dissemination of data to users. RODEO will make data discoverable and will support the deployment
of national data portals and API

RODEO builds upon an existing EUMETNET design for a shared federated data infrastructure. The project is divided into Work Packages for the development of a User
Interface, Real-Time Meteorological Information, Warnings, Climate Information, High-Volume Meteorological Information and User and Provider Engagement and Support.
RODEO will strengthen the capability of the public European meteorological data providers to provide open access to their data via harmonised APIs, common data
catalogue, subscription services, joint API management and common formats to support the development of information products and services and AI applications. RODEO is
designed to make weather data open and available and to unite both the data providers and consumers, thereby making a significant impact in Europe. Substantial
efficiency is gained from aligning the project objectives and goals to EUMETNET and NMHSs future strategies.
