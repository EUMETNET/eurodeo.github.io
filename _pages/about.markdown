# Introduction

A project called the Provision of Open Access to Public Meteorological Data and Development of Shared Federated Data Infrastructure for the Development of Information Products
and Services (RODEO) is a joint effort by eleven European National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF) and the network of 31 European National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (EUMETNET). [The Project Partners](https://github.com/EURODEO/eurodeo.github.io/edit/main/_pages/about.markdown#partners) are listed in a section below. 

The RODEO project develops a user interface and Application Programming Interfaces (API) for accessing meteorological datasets declared as High Value Datasets (HVD) by the EU
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/138 under the EU Open Data Directive (EU) 2019/1024. The project also fosters the engagement between data providers and data users for
enhancing the understanding of technical solutions to be available for sharing and accessing the HVD datasets.

Surface weather observations, climate data, weather warnings, radar data and numerical weather prediction (NWP) data are defined as meteorological high valu datasets.
The distribution of these datasets is going to be made available under an open licence, in machine-readable formats using APIs and bulk downloads following the FAIR
principles (usability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability).

The project is funded by the EU Digital Europe Program (DIGITAL) and EUMETNET.

## Project Aims & Goals

The project makes meteorological High Value Datasets easily available with an aim to bring new data to businesses, public
administrations and citizens. The project reinforces
the European public meteorological data infrastructure and enhances the providersâ€™ digital capacity to share data.

The project strengthens the capacity of the European meteorological data providers to comply with the HVD Implementing Regulation by:
- Developing a user interface
- Developing APIs for accessing weather observation data, climate data, weather radar data, warnings, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
datasets
- Developing a data catalogue for making data discoverable
- Engaging with the data owners and user communities
- Supporting the deployment of national data portals and APIs
- Making HVDs available from the project partners

## Impact on users

The increased availability of data boosts entrepreneurship and potentially results in the creation of new companies. New open datasets
are an important resource for small and medium-sized enterprises to develop new digital products and services. Reuse of data opens
business opportunities for several sectors which ultimately leads attracting more investors. By making data much easier to use,
reseach, academia, AI applications and many other application areas can utilize the data more efficiently.   

Overall, better data availability leads to better warnings, forecasts, and services to the public and weather-critical industries, and
contributes to the safe and efficient functioning of society with multiple benefits across the European economy, industry, and
society.
