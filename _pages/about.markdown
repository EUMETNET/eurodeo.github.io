# Introduction

The Provision of Open Access to Public Meteorological Data and Development of Shared Federated Data Infrastructure for the Development of Information Products and
Services (RODEO) project is a joint effort by eleven European National Meteorological and Hydrological Services NMHSs, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF) and the network of 31 European National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (EUMETNET). The Project Partners are listed in a section below. 

The RODEO project develops a user interface and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for meteorological datasets declared as High Value Datasets (HVD) by the EU
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/138 under the EU Open Data Directive (EU) 2019/1024. The project also fosters the engagement between data providers and data users for
enhancing the understanding of technical solutions to be available for sharing and accessing the datasets.

The meteorological HVD requirements are defined for surface weather observations, climate data, weather warnings, radar data and numerical weather prediction (NWP) data.
The distribution of data is going to be made available under an open licence, in machine-readable formats using APIs and bulk downloads, and following the FAIR principles
(usability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability).

The project is funded by the EU Digital Europe Program (DEP) and EUMETNET.

RODEO strengthens the capability of the public European meteorological data providers to provide open access to their data via harmonised APIs, common data
catalogue, subscription services, joint API management and common formats to support the development of information products and services and AI applications. RODEO is
designed to make weather data open and available and to unite both the data providers and consumers, thereby making a significant impact in Europe. 

## Project Aims & Goals

The project makes meteorological High Value Datasets easily available with an aim to bring digital infrastructure and new data to businesses, public administrations
and citizens. 

The project reinforces the European public meteorological data infrastructure and enhances the providers’ digital capacity to make them more ready for future technologies.

The project strengthens the capacity of the European meteorological data providers to comply with the HVD Implementing Regulation by:
- Developing a user interface
- Developing APIs for accessing weather observation data, climate data, weather radar data, warnings, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) datasets
- Developing a data catalogue for making data discoverable
- Engaging with the data owners and user communities
- Supporting the deployment of national data portals and APIs
- Making HVDs available from the project partners

## Impact on users

The increased availability of data boosts entrepreneurship and result in the creation of new companies. New open datasets are an important resource for small and medium
companies to develop new digital products and services, reuse of data opens business opportunities for several sectors. This ultimately leads attracting more investors.
There is also more data available for the use of research which enables more results and information for policymaking.

The project supports AI applications by making meteorological data much easier to use. It also includes dedicated datasets ready for AI  ingestion by data consumers to
further illustrate to consumers the uses of the data to various purposes. 

Overall, better data availability leads to better warnings, forecasts, and services to the public and weather-critical industries -> contributes to the safe and efficient
functioning of society with multiple benefits across the European economy, industry, and society.
