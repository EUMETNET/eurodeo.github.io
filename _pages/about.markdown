# Introduction

The Provision of Open Access to Public Meteorological Data and Development of Shared Federated Data Infrastructure for the Development of Information Products and
Services (RODEO) project is a joint effort by eleven European National Meteorological and Hydrological Services NMHSs, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF) and the network of 31 European National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (EUMETNET). The Project Partners are listed in a section below. 

The project makes meteorological High Value Datasets (HVD) easily available with an aim to bring digital infrastructure and new data to businesses, public 
administrations and citizens. 

The European Commission published a list of high-value datasets in late 2022. Meteorological HVDs are defined for weather observation data, climate data, weather 
warnings, weather radar data and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) data. These HVDs shall be free of charge openly accessible via Application Programming Interfaces 
(APIs) in machine-readable formats and bulk downloadable.

RODEO strengthens the capability of the public European meteorological data providers to provide open access to their data via harmonised APIs, common data
catalogue, subscription services, joint API management and common formats to support the development of information products and services and AI applications. RODEO is
designed to make weather data open and available and to unite both the data providers and consumers, thereby making a significant impact in Europe.
