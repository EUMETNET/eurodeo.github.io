## User interface

## Real-time surface weather observations

The project enables increased sharing of surface in-situ observations and to allow a gradual transition from the use of the WMO Global Telecommunication System (GTS) to the
use of programming interfaces for collection and distribution of surface weather observations. The surface weather observations declared as High Value Datasets (HVD) shall be
made available through open web services, so that they can be accessed by anyone. Currently, the temporal resolution of the GTS based data delivery is 1 hour. In contrast, the project will deliver sub-hourly surface observations in real-time. An API for all observation variables will be developed to serve data from the project partners at
minimum, and with the capability to be adopted by other providers of meteorological surface observations.

## Warnings
The project improves the accessibility and usability of weather warnings across Europe, ensuring that warning data is reliable, high quality, and harmonised across different
regions and countries. The main goal is to make warning data easily accessible and usable by others, particularly in new application areas.

One of the key activities of the project is the development of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for warnings, which will not only provide machine-readable data
but also allow for real-time access to warning data through bulk downloads and cross-border querying. The project aims to further improve the sharing and accessibility of
weather warnings by linking these APIs with the already-existing MeteoAlarm service. By doing so, the project seeks to offer open access to this valuable data.

In addition, the  project focuses on improving the quality and harmonisation of warning data. This involves coordination with data providers, re-users, and
international framework activities related to the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).

The project's activities are expected to have a significant impact on the ability of individuals and organisations to take necessary precautions in the face of severe weather
events, and to mitigate risks to life and property. By improving the sharing and accessibility of weather warnings, the project will contribute to more effective disaster
preparedness and response at both the national and international level.
