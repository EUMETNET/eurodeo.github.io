## User interface

## Real-time Met data

## Warnings
The RODEO project aims to improve the accessibility and usability of weather warnings across Europe, ensuring that warning data is reliable, high
quality, and harmonised across different regions and countries. The main goal is to make warning data easily accessible and usable by others, particularly in new
application areas.

The project activities will have a significant impact on the ability of individuals and organisations to take necessary precautions in the face of severe weather events,
and to mitigate risks to life and property. By improving the sharing and accessibility of weather warnings, the project will contribute to more effective disaster
preparedness and response at both the national and international level.

To achieve these objectives, the project will develop APIs for warnings that allow machine-readable access to the data, improve the quality and harmonisation of
warning data, and make it available in real-time via bulk download and querying over cross-border domains. This will involve coordination with data providers, re-users,
and international framework activities related to the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).
