## User interface - MeteoGate

The user interface is called MeteoGate. This project activity creates a ‘One-Stop Shop’ for meteorological data and information in Europe,
following the EUMETNET FEMDI (Federated European Meteo-hydrological Data Infrastructure) initiative. FEMDI provides
an integrated view of all the data available through the RODEO project, and provides the ability to access it 
while leaving data where it is. 

The activity develops and implements the FEMDI Community components needed to deliver shared capabilities: Data
catalogue; Message broker; and, Data access (API Management). The work is closely aligned with the development of
the World Meteorological Organizations's (WMO) Information System 2.0 (WIS 2.0) system. 

Once operational, the user interface is useable by Data Publishers and Data Consumers inside and outside the hydro
meteorological community.


## Real-time surface weather observations

This project activity provides a sustainable and standardized system for sharing real-time surface weather
observations in line with the HVD regulation and WMO WIS 2.0 strategy. The real-time surface weather observations
are made available through open web services, so that they can be accessed by anyone. 

An API for all observation variables is developed to provide data from the meteorological data providers. The
system architecture is portable, scalable and modular system for taking into account possible extension to
additional networks and datasets (e.g. 3rd party surface observations) in the future.

## Warnings

The activity improves the accessibility and usability of weather warnings across Europe, ensuring that warning data
is reliable, high quality, and harmonised across different regions and countries. The main goal is to make warning
data easily accessible and usable by others, particularly in new application areas.

APIs for real-time and archived warnings are developed, which is not only providing machine-readable data
but also allowing for real-time access to warning data through bulk downloads and cross-border querying. The
activity aims to further improve the sharing and accessibility of weather warnings by linking these APIs with the
already-existing MeteoAlarm service. By doing so, the project seeks to offer open access to this valuable data.

In addition, this activity focuses on improving the quality and harmonisation of warning data. This involves
coordination with data providers, re-users, and international framework activities related to the Common Alerting
Protocol (CAP).

The project's activities are expected to have a significant impact on the ability of individuals and organisations
to take necessary precautions in the face of severe weather events, and to mitigate risks to life and property. By
improving the sharing and accessibility of weather warnings, the project contributes to more effective disaster
preparedness and response at both the national and international level.

## Climate data

The climate data activity develops a uniform, free, and automated access to quality controlled historical climate
observations on a European scale regardless of country borders. This activity allows direct access to nine
national climate databases and the European Climate Assessment and Database via APIs through the FEMDI ‘One-Stop
Shop’ user interface. 

Uniformity across the available climate data is guaranteed by a standard format for both climate data series and
extensive metadata. The format is goin to be well-documented to ensure compatibility of the high value datasets
from different sources, allowing potential envisioned data providers to join with ease. 

Researchers, from academia, private sector or (non-) governmental bodies can retrieve the user-friendly machine
readable climate observations to facilitate a wide use of climate data. 

## Weather radar data

Weather radar data plays a crucial role in various sectors, including weather forecasting especially for aviation,
early warning systems, and disaster preparedness. The applications using this data vary from data assimilation to
flood warnings and the monitoring of animal migration.

The OPERA program (Operational Program for Exchange of Weather Radar Information) under EUMETNET has been
facilitating radar cooperation among national weather services in Europe for over 20 years. OPERA has its own
independent data model, operates data centres, and generates Pan-European radar composites.

The main objective of this project activity is to provide API access to radar data and developed products, aligning
with the HVD regulation. The shared datasets include European radar composites in
real-time and an archive spanning over 10 years. Additionally, the activity provides a cache of 24-hour operational
exchangedradar volume data and an extensive archive of radar volume data in Europe, which can be used, for example,
for AI training purposes. Furthermore, in compliance with the HVD regulations, the project aims to make national
radar composites and products accessible for demonstrative purposes. 

This project activity contributes to the availability and usability of weather radar information, benefiting
various sectors. It allows the users to explore the capabilities and applications of radar data at a continental
level.


## AI datasets

The applications of enhanced meteorological data support Artificial Intelligence (AI) by making meteorological data
much easier to use for AI applications and increasing the level of data available across Europe. The project opens
dedicated datasets ready for AI ingestion by data consumers to further illustrate to consumers the uses of the data
to various purposes. The meteorological community is also an active developer of AI solutions and will itself
also greatly benefit from the outcomes of this project.

## User engagement and communications

Successful engagement with both the data owner community and the user community is crucial for the success of RODEO. 

This activity supports the other project activities on their communications with both the providers and the users, with appropriate communications channels being used for each group. The activity ensures that the developed project components are usable by developing onboarding processes, guidance and user material and carrying out testing of the components by projects partners. 

The activity engages with end users through the Project External Advisory Board, a user group, user surveys, and seminars to facilitate sharing of HVDs, and to foster uptake and use of HVDs. This activity also improves public
administrations’ knowledge of the HVD regulation and their benefits to the economy, especially SMEs.
