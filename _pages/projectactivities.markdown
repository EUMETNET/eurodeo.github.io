## User interface

## Real-time surface weather observations

The objective of this project activity is to provide a sustainable and standardized system for sharing real-time surface weather observations in line with the World
Meteorological Organization’s (WMO) Information System 2.0 (WIS 2.0) strategy and the HVD regulation. The real-time surface weather observations are made available through
open web services, so that they can be accessed by anyone. 

An API for all observation variables is developed to provide data from the meteorological data providers. The system architechture is portable, scalable and modular system 
for taking into account possible extension to additional networks and datasets (e.g. 3rd party surface observations).

## Warnings
The project improves the accessibility and usability of weather warnings across Europe, ensuring that warning data is reliable, high quality, and harmonised across different
regions and countries. The main goal is to make warning data easily accessible and usable by others, particularly in new application areas.

One of the key activities is the development of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for warnings, which is not only providing machine-readable data
but also allowing for real-time access to warning data through bulk downloads and cross-border querying. The project aims to further improve the sharing and accessibility of
weather warnings by linking these APIs with the already-existing MeteoAlarm service. By doing so, the project seeks to offer open access to this valuable data.

In addition, this activity focuses on improving the quality and harmonisation of warning data. This involves coordination with data providers, re-users, and
international framework activities related to the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).

The project's activities are expected to have a significant impact on the ability of individuals and organisations to take necessary precautions in the face of severe weather
events, and to mitigate risks to life and property. By improving the sharing and accessibility of weather warnings, the project contributes to more effective disaster
preparedness and response at both the national and international level.

## User engagement and communications

Successful engagement with both the data owner community and the user community is crucial for the success of RODEO. 

This activity supports the other project activities on their communications with both the providers and the users, with appropriate communications channels being used for each
group. The activity ensures that the developed project components are usable by developing onboarding processes, guidance and user material and carrying out testing of the
components by projects partners. 

The activity engages with end users through the Project External Advisory Board, a user group, user surveys, and seminars to facilitate sharing of HVDs, and to foster uptake and use of HVDs. This activity also improves public
administrations’ knowledge of the HVD regulation and their benefits to the economy, especially SMEs.
