## Real-time Met data

## Warnings
The RODEO project aims to improve the accessibility and usability of weather warnings across Europe, ensuring that warning data is reliable, high quality, and harmonised across different regions and countries. The main goal is to make warning data easily accessible and usable by others, particularly in new application areas.

One of the key activities of the RODEO project is the development of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for warnings, which will not only provide machine-readable data but also allow for real-time access to warning data through bulk downloads and cross-border querying. The project aims to further improve the sharing and accessibility of weather warnings by linking these APIs with the already-existing MeteoAlarm service. By doing so, the project seeks to offer open access to this valuable data.

In addition, the RODEO project will focus on improving the quality and harmonisation of warning data. This will involve coordination with data providers, re-users, and international framework activities related to the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).

The project's activities are expected to have a significant impact on the ability of individuals and organisations to take necessary precautions in the face of severe weather events, and to mitigate risks to life and property. By improving the sharing and accessibility of weather warnings, the project will contribute to more effective disaster preparedness and response at both the national and international level.
